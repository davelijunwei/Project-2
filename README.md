I created a single page application for fast and easy tracking of your personal portfolio without a need to constantly login to your TradingHub.

Users can do the following
1) Track timeline of stock owned
2) Track overall % growth
3) View current prices * not live due to API restriction
4) Simulate past prices and earnings
